                            <p>AWS's S3 storage option offers a cost effective and straightforward solution to hosting a digital portfolio or CV. I developed a Bootstrap site, used git during development for version control, and uploaded the master branch to an S3 bucket for hosting. Refer to my GitHub repository for this site <a href="https://github.com/Ronser/resume">here</a>.</p>
                            
                            <p>The basic steps in hosting a website with a custom domain in an S3 bucket are the following:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Register a domain for your site.</li>
                                <li>Create an S3 bucket for your HTML files and assets.</li>
                                <li>Configure your bucket to allow for public access to the Internet.</li>
                                <li>Route DNS traffic for your domain to your website bucket.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>You can visit the official AWS documentation for completing these steps here: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/getting-started-s3.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/getting-started-s3.html</a></p>

                                <p>Take note! I opened an issue on AWS's GitHub page for these steps: <a href="https://github.com/awsdocs/amazon-route53-docs/issues/30">https://github.com/awsdocs/amazon-route53-docs/issues/30</a></p>
                                <p>The documentation seems to be out of step with some of the dialogs. Read this issue to see some potential pitfalls with the documentation at present.</p>

                    <h2 class="mb-5">Project Everwatch: Using an ultrasonic sensor to detect movement</h2>
                    <div class="d-flex flex-column flex-md-row justify-content-between mb-5">
                        <div class="flex-grow-1">
                            <p>The idea of Everwatch came from the burglary of my neighbour’s home. The intruders gained access by opening my neighbour's letterbox and then opening the front door. This was observed from a security camera across the street. I was worried that my house might also be targeted. I decided to create a prototype for my home to detect and deter burglars.</p>
                            <p>The Everwatch system detects movement at a specific point, for example a door handle or a letterbox. I designed the system to deter the intruder with warning signals and then notify the homeowner with the option of further custom responses.</p>
                            <p>While typical burglar alarm systems available on the market today detect intrusions, they don’t necessarily detect attempted intrusions. These traditional systems use magnetic strip sensors, internal infrared motion sensors or break glass sound sensors. However, if a burglar tries to open your front door at 2am by turning the handle, or if they look in the letterbox, this won’t trigger a traditional alarm system. This is data that is not captured by traditional systems, yet could be informative to the homeowner’s decision-making process.</p>
                            <p>Everwatch captures this information in the cloud, and deters intruders using LED lights and an LCD messaging system. The owner is immediately notified of movement by email. The homeowner can then choose to ignore the alarm, or can remotely trigger a piezo alarm by clicking a button on a HTML page. The intent is to deter the intruder at an early stage of their investigation of the property, and empower the homeowner with an immediate custom response, as well as event data over a period of time for further analysis.</p>

In the video, you can see that the time on my phone is 12:10am so apologies if I stumble over my words, I was a bit tired!</p>
